need to include a bit about the Makefile here


Experimental procedure


list of what we did:

* Board was set up w/ jumpers and such
* Leds and buttons were hooked up in hardware
* Leds and buttons were hooked up in software
* Code was split into separate files
* Audio was hooked up with apropriate settings
* Sound was tested to work using random noise


the following two groups of bullet points happened in parallel:

* a C sound effect synth inspired by sfxr was prototyped on a PC
* the synth was ported to avr32
* the synth was developed further on the avr32
* the synth was used in the stk1000 program to play various sound effects

* a C MOD player library + python tools inspired by amiga trackers were developed on a PC
* the library was tested on the avr32 and needed a great deal of optimization
* a great deal of optimization occurred 
* the library was used in the stk1000 program to play selected mods


finally:

* the actual main program flow was decided upon and written, hooking button and led behaviour together with sound effects and music
