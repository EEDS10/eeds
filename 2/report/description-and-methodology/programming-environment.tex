\subsection{JTAGICE}
We can reference our previous report here, so that we don't have to write so much.

\subsection{GNU Debugger}
since last time:
* discovered tui mode: looks nice, breaks the makefile
* avr32gdbproxy -f0.8Mb -a 0.0.0.0:1024 and target extended-remote:1024

\subsection{Make}
we can reference.

\subsection{Other tools}

\begin{itemize}
\item OpenMPT, a MOD tracker, was used to examine MOD files during the development of libmodam.
\item \texttt{vim} was employed as the authors' text editor of choice.
\item \texttt{git} was used for version control.
\item The project was hosted in a private GitHub repository.
\item The report was written with \LaTeX.
\item AVR32-specific flavors of GNU's \texttt{as} and \texttt{ld} were used to assemble and link executables.
\item \texttt{avr32program} was used to program the STK1000 with the JTAGICE.
\item The sound effects were recorded using Audacity on an ASUS UL30JT laptop.
