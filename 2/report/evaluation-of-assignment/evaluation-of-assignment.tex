Writing the lab-reports using the required design (Abstract, introduction, description and methodology, results and tests, evaluation of assignment, conclusion, references) felt a bit weird at first, probably because we did not read the supplied material regarding lab reports.

The assignment/compendium could include some questions for the students to reflect over, to push them in the right direction regarding what's important to include in the report.
As it is now, there aren't that many relevant tests (in hindsight, at least) beyond ``does it work per the assignment's specification?''.

All in all though we had fun and the experience was pretty enjoyable.
