Writing the lab-reports using the required design (Abstract, introduction, description and methodology, results and tests, evaluation of assignment, conclusion, references) does not feel entirely appropriate.
Mostly because the entire report seems to end up in description and methodology.
Also there really aren't any relevant tests to perform (that are relevant to the assignment) beyond ``does it work per the assignment's specification?''.
