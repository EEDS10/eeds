Writing the lab-reports using the required design (Abstract, introduction, description and methodology, results and tests, evaluation of assignment, conclusion, references) felt a bit weird at first, as the structure seems in part to be made for a report testing a principal hypothesis.

The assignment/compendium could include some questions for the students to reflect over, to push them in the right direction regarding what's important to include in the report.
As it is now, there aren't that many relevant tests (in hindsight, at least) beyond ``does it work per the assignment's specification?''.

All in all though we had fun and the experience was pretty enjoyable.
