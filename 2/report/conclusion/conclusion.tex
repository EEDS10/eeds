%``And so we find ourselves standing here, at the end of it all, gazing upon the work which has been done.''
The finished program is capable of playing different sounds when different buttons are pushed; including three different sound effects and one start-up melody.
It is also capable of playing modfiles, represented as an array of integers.
Measures taken to increase the energy efficiency of the program resulted in a reduction of the quality of the sounds, illustrating that energy efficiency cannot always be achieved without sacrifice.
The authors feel the assignment has further increased their proficiency and familiarity with C and hardware-level programming, as well as sound theory.
In conclusion, the project was completed according to the specifications within the given timeframe.
In the world of business, this is commonly known as ``great success''.
