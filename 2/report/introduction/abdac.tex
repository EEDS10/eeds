An Audio Bitstream Digital-to-Analog Converter is a component which converts a digital bitstream signal to an analog signal.
It is useful for, amongst other things, playing a PCM-coded sample stream as analog audio.
The STK1000 has two Audio Bitstream Digital-to-Analog Converters, the internal DAC and the external DAC.
The presented solution program uses the internal DAC to play sound.

The internal DAC is capable of converting a 16 bit digital stereo stream with its oversampling architecture. The oversampling ratio is fixed at 128x, and the output is processed with a FIR equalization filter, a Comb4 digital interpolation filter and 3rd order sigma-delta digital/analog converters.\ref{ap7000-manual}
The internal DAC is also connected to the DMA, but this feature is not used in the solution.
