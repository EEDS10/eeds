An Audio Bitstream Digital-to-Analog Converter is a component which converts a digital bitstream signal to an analog signal.
It is useful for, amongst other things, playing a PCM-coded sample stream as analog audio.
The STK1000 has two Audio Bitstream Digital-to-Analog Converters, the internal DAC and the external DAC.
The presented solution program uses the internal DAC to play sound.
