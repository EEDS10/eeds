Remember to bring an oscilloscope to have a look at different waveforms! Also, we could have a look at the random noise from the stk1000.

\section{Energy Efficiency}

(we threw this out the window :3 )
because of reasons. don't forget the reasons.

Some talk about how we chose to not turn off the abdac, even though it would be more efficient.


\section{Testing}
We loaded up the code and pushed a button and omg it worked because it played sounds.
Also that one test where we just loaded the code to play a sound and it also worked.


\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Ideas for improvement}

* external dac
* sleeping to save power? ( hah, like we have time for that )
* actually setting the proper sample rate instead of hacking it
* DMA for the ABDAC
