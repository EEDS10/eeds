Remember to bring an oscilloscope to have a look at different waveforms! Also, we could have a look at the random noise from the stk1000.

\section{Energy Efficiency}

(we threw this out the window :3 )
because of reasons. don't forget the reasons.

Some talk about how we chose to not turn off the abdac, even though it would be more efficient.

We do sleeping when there is nothing special to play now, wee :D


\section{Testing}
We loaded up the code and pushed a button and omg it worked because it played sounds.
Also that one test where we just loaded the code to play a sound and it also worked.
The test where we recorded sound effects to see if the ADSR worked as expected.
The test where we triggered led changes from the abdac_isr to measure oscillator speed (learned that div wasn't working how we thought it did, led to a hack, then finally figuring out a solution).


\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Ideas for improvement}

* external dac
* DMA for the ABDAC
