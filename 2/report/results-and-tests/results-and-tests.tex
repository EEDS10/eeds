Remember to bring an oscilloscope to have a look at different waveforms! Also, we could have a look at the random noise from the stk1000.

\section{Energy Efficiency}

Energy efficiency in computing is ever-important.
The presented solution program undertakes several measures to stay as energy efficient as possible.
When the program is in idle mode, i.e. is not playing a sound, the CPU and HSB are turned off.
They are turned on again by button interrupts as soon as they are needed again.
The ABDAC is not switched off, however, as it makes a loud and ugly popping noise when it is switched on or off.
This popping noise is detrimental to the user experience, and ruins the functionality of the program.

\section{Testing}
We loaded up the code and pushed a button and omg it worked because it played sounds.
Also that one test where we just loaded the code to play a sound and it also worked.
The test where we recorded sound effects to see if the ADSR worked as expected.
The test where we triggered led changes from the abdac_isr to measure oscillator speed (learned that div wasn't working how we thought it did, led to a hack, then finally figuring out a solution).


\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Ideas for improvement}

* external dac
* DMA for the ABDAC
