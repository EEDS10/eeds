Tests and their results.

Should also include a discussion of the results.

The Discussion is the most important part of 
your report, because here, you show that you 
understand the experiment beyond the simple level 
of completing it.
Explain. Analyse. Interpret.
Some people like to think of this as the 
``subjective'' part of the report. 
By that, they mean this is what is not readily observable.
This part of the lab focuses on a question of understanding 
``What is the significance or meaning of the 
results?''
To answer this question, use both aspects 
of discussion, 
a) Analysis and
b) Interpretation.

a) Analysis: What do the results indicate clearly?
What have you found?
Explain what you know with certainty based on your results and draw conclusions.

b) Interpretation: What is the significance of the 
results?
What ambiguities exist?
What questions might we raise?
Find logical explanations for problems in the data.
