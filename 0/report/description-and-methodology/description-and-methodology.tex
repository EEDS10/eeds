This is a combination of the methods and materials/equipment and experimental procedure bits found in typical lab reports.

Methods and Materials (or Equipment):
 can usually be a simple list, but make sure it is 
accurate and complete.
In some cases, you can simply direct the reader to a lab manual or standard procedure: 
“Equipment was set up as in CHE 276 manual.”

Experimental Procedure: 
describes the process in chronological order.
Using clear paragraph structure, explain all steps in the order 
they actually happened, not as they were supposed 
to happen.
If your professor says you can simply 
state that you followed the procedure in the 
manual, be sure you still document occasions 
when you did not follow that exactly (e.g. “At step 
4 we performed four repetitions instead of three, 
and ignored the data from the second repetition”). 
If you've done it right, another researcher should 
be able to duplicate your experiment.
