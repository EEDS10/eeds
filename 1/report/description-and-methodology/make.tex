GNU Make, a scriptable build tool, was employed in the development of the paddle program.
The handout files included a sample Makefile, which was used mostly without modification.
After the development of the program was complete, and how to use the debugger became clear (see the previous section), a make command to quickly enter debug mode was included.
This command could be invoked by writing \texttt{make debug}.
Additionally, and somewhat self-referentially, a Makefile for easy compiling of this \LaTeX report was used.
