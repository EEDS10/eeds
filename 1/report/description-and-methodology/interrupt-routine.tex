The button interrupt routine first reads the state of the buttons by calling another routine which stores the buttons' states in \texttt{r12}, as detailed in listing 16.
\code{190}{191}{Read button state.}
Once the buttons' state has been read, the debouncing routine (\cite{lab-compendium}, Figure 2.9a) is called to prevent bouncing (see listing 18).
\code{193}{194}{Debounce!}
The debouncing routine keeps the processor busy by repeatedly subtracting one from some value\footnote{This value is specified as the \texttt{DEBOUNCE} constant in the code.} until it reaches zero. As we have not yet notified the processor that the interrupt has been handled, this prevents further interrupts from being registered until the debouncing is finished.
The last thing the interrupt routine does before returning is notify the processor that the interrupt has been handled, by reading the Interrupt Status Register (see listing 19).
The value is stored in \texttt{r0}, which is the designated free-for-all register.
