A working paddle move program was successfully implemented in an energy-efficient fashion as per the assignment's specifications, despite the difficulties encountered along the way.
Although the power consumption tests showed near-negligible changes in the various energy efficiency optimizations of the program, there is reason to doubt their relevance and accuracy.
The authors' understanding of and experience with the GNU toolchain, assembly programming, Makefiles, technical manuals and interrupt handling in assembly for the AVR32 has been greatly lifted.
