This report presents a solution to assignment \#1 of TDT4258 at NTNU, spring 2013.
In the assigment, an Atmel STK1000 development board was programmed to display a moveable LED ''paddle'' using AVR32 assembly and the GNU toolchain.
Interrupts were used rather than busy-waiting to achieve better energy efficiency.
The goal of this assignment was to introduce students to programming microcontrollers in an energy-efficient fashion, as well as introducing students to the GNU toolchain, and specifically GNU Makefiles and using GDB as a debugging tool.
