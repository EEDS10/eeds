The finished product is a functioning video game that can be played on an STK1000 running Linux -- per the assignment's requirements.

The authors feel that while this probably merits some deduction in points, they sure hope it won't happen.
After all it works, right?


Here is a video demonstration of the finished game: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtuirtDMYXU
