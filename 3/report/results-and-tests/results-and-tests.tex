	\subsection{Evaluating the efficiency of functions}
		Select functions print their runtime/TTC (time to completion) to the console, allowing an evaluation to be made regarding their efficiency.
		This facilitates the evaluation of changes made to functions: if a change in the function results in an increase in its runtime, the change did not contribute to increased efficiency.

		This particular technique is a kind of profiling\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_(computer_programming)}} dubbed ``ghetto profiling'' by one of the authors. 

\section{Gameplay tests}
	we had people test the gameplay.
	those who did not enjoy themselves were eliminated.
