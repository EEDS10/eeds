drivers, game engine, .sm file format
something something let's get back to this part later.

yo we made them drivers

then we made them font engine

and implemented the .sm format

then we made some graphics

and implemented transparency

then we played dat music

and got the steps to synch up to it

\subsection{Features left unimplemented}
	here are some features we did not have time to implement


	preview of the selected song in the main menu

	other step types (doubles, mines, holds)

	multithreading
		the entire vidya is single threaded, meaning the playback of music runs in the same thread as the rest of the game. Because threading is for pussies.
