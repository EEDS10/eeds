drivers, game engine, .sm file format
something something let's get back to this part later.

yo we made them drivers

then we made them font engine

and implemented the .sm format

then we made some graphics

% digression about test resulting in us dropping 2-player mode
We did some prototype testing and came to the conclusion that having two players control each trying to use four buttons on the board simultaneously did not result in an enjoyable experience.
Our testers preferred being the sole user of the STK1000's buttons.
A possible explanation for this is that all of our testers were above the age of 20 and did not posess the child-like hand size required to operate four neighbouring STK1000 buttons at the same time.

and implemented transparency

then we played dat music

and got the steps to synch up to it

\subsection{Features left unimplemented}
	here are some features we did not have time to implement


	preview of the selected song in the main menu

	other step types (doubles, mines, holds)
		Note: SLDDD treats each individual arrow as a step. 

	multithreading
		the entire vidya is single threaded, meaning the playback of music runs in the same thread as the rest of the game. Because threading is for pussies.
