The solution video game is a rhythm video game and is controlled using the STK1000's buttons.
The LEDs are used to indicate which buttons are relevant at the present.
\subsection{The gameplay of Scorched Land Dance Dance Defence}
	\subsubsection{The role of the LEDs}
		The LEDs are used to indicate which buttons that can be pressed in each state.
		For example: during gameplay \texttt{LED7}, \texttt{LED5}, \texttt{LED3} and \texttt{LED2} are lit, corresponding to the buttons used to play the game.
	\subsubsection{Splash screen}
		The \textit{splash screen} is the first screen displayed to the player.
		It states the name of the game and sports some flame-like effect thing.
		Pressing \texttt{SW3} advances the game to the \textit{song selection menu}.
		Check out figure~\ref{img-splashscreen}.

		\end{figure}
	\subsubsection{Song selection menu}
		This is the menu from which the player selects which song he or she wishes to play.
		Pressing \texttt{SW3} selects the highlighted song, while pressing \texttt{SW2} traverses the list one song upwards and \texttt{SW1} traverses the list one song downards.

		In addition to \texttt{LED1}, \texttt{LED2} and \texttt{LED3} being lit when this screen is active, three icons are visible in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.
		These indicate the consequence of pushing the corresponding buttons.

	\subsubsection{In-song gameplay}
		When a song is selected in the \textit{song selection menu}, figure~\ref{img-insong} is pretty much what appears.
		The song's background image is rendered with a slightly transparent overlay of four white rectangles each with a hexagon outlined at the top.
		The hexagons scroll upwards.

		\texttt{SW7} corresponds to the leftmost stationary hexagon, \texttt{SW5} to the second one from the left, \texttt{SW3} to the second one from the right and \texttt{SW1} to the rightmost.
		The given judgments are displayed at the top of the screen, while the combo counter is visible roughly in the middle of it.
		
		The gameplay consists of pressing the appropriate buttons when a moving hexagon is on top of the stationary hexagon outline.
		A judgment is given for each moving hexagon, depending on how close it is to its corresponding stationary hexagon when the appropriate button is pressed.
		Judgments are calculated from the moving hexagon's pixel offset from the stationary hexagon, see table~\ref{table-judgments} for a full list.

		Audio plays (in fact, the \textit{song} plays) while the game is in this state.
		\begin{table}[h]
			\centering
		    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
		    \hline
		    Judgment & Timing (offset in pixels) \\ \hline
		    Perfect & [0,3] \\ \hline
		    Great! & [4,9] \\ \hline
		    O.K. & [10,19] \\ \hline
		    \end{tabular}
		    \caption{The judgments in SLDDD and their offsets.}
		    \label{table-judgments}
		\end{table}
	
		When the song is finished the game advances to the \textit{score screen}.
		Pressing \texttt{SW0} causes the game to return to the \textit{song selection screen}.

	\subsubsection{Score screen}
		The \textit{score screen} summarizes the player's performance in a song.
		An enumeration of each judgment, the player's highest combo count during the song as well as a score are displayed here.
		The score is calculating by adding the number of perfects, greats and O.K.s multiplied with their weights. Perfect is weighted 4, great has a weight of 2 and O.K. has a weight of 1.

		Pressing \texttt{SW0} returns to the \textit{song selection screen}.
