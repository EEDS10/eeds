\subsection{Jumpers}
	The jumpers on the STK1000 were set to the positions specified on page 61 of the lab compendium\cite{lab-compendium}.

\subsection{GPIO Connections}
	Two flat cables of the same type used in assignment 1\cite{tdt4258-1} and 2\cite{tdt4258-2} were used to connect the buttons (\texttt{J25}) to \texttt{GPIO 0-GPIO7} (\texttt{J1}) and the LEDs (\texttt{J15}) to \texttt{GPIO 8-15} (\texttt{J2}).
	In the previous exercises the LEDs were connected to \texttt{GPIO 16-31} but this was not possible in this assignment due to requirement that the jumper \texttt{SW6} is set to 
	\texttt{MACB0/DMAC}\cite{lab-compendium} (page 21).

\subsection{Audio}
	The audio was configured as in \cite{tdt4258-2}.
