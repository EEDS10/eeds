The Introduction: is more narrowly focused 
than the abstract.
It states 
a) the objective of the experiment and 
b) provides the reader with background to the experiment.
State the topic of your report clearly and concisely, in one or two sentences.

A good introduction also provides whatever 
background theory, previous research, or formulas 
the reader needs to know.
Usually, an instructor does not want you to repeat the lab manual, but to show your own comprehension of the problem.
If the amount of introductory material seems to be a lot, consider adding subheadings such as: ``Theoretical Principles'' or ``Background''.
