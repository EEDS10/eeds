Scorched Land Defense (SLD) is a warfare tactic. The assignment requests that a computer game with the given title be written.

Our version of SLD puts the player in the position of a lord of war, as he or she must hit the appropriate buttons in the given sequence within set time windows in order to either burn or put out burning crops, depending on which side the player chooses to imagine him or herself playing for.
In two player mode, the players might pretend to cooperate towards the same goal or play against each other.
