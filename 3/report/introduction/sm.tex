\subsection{Dance Dance Revolution}
Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) is a music video game series produced by Konami.
The series' gameplay involves the player using his or her feet to step on portions of a platform corresponding to arrows that appear on the screen to the beat of a song.
During gameplay arrows scroll across the screen (typically from the bottom of the screen and upwards), eventually passing over a set of stationary arrows before reaching the opposite end of the screen.
The game's objective is for the player to hit the corresponding arrows on the \textit{dance platform} when a scrolling arrow overlaps with the stationary arrows.
The player is given a judgment based on the accuracy which with they hit each note.
A sufficiently poor judgment will decrease the player's life bar.
The player's life bar reaching zero results in a game over.

\subsection{StepMania}
StepMania (SM) is a cross-platform open source rhythm video game which was developed as a Dance Dance Revolution simulator, released under the MIT license.
It allows for custom songs (known as ``Stepfiles'') and further modification of gameplay elements (such as the timing of judgments).
While originally developed as a DDR simulator, it is often played using a keyboard rather than a dance platform.
