vi letet gjennom boksen med sd-kort og valgte et SanDisk Ultra II 2.0GB, med USB 2.0 kompabilitet. Dette var det kortet med mest lagringsplass.
Når bryteren på kortet er nede (nærmest usb-enden) er det i skrivebeskyttet modus ("lock")

Vi følger instruksjonene i oeving3_guidelines.txt

after exiting cfdisk there is a slight delay before it lets you open it again. In this window it just tells you "FATAL ERROR: Cannot open disk drive"

during stage 5/6 the sdcard is not automagically mounted in media/<name assigned in step 4>. Manually mounting it requires root. We attempted to drop down to graphical mode.

We decided to get a new sdcard because our initial pick was pre-broken.

wait why does it work to request the same range on both the led and button drivers? According to http://www.makelinux.net/ldd3/chp-9-sect-2 it seems like it shouldn't.

We are using Allegro 4.2

We are implementing stuff from stepmania

hardware flow control in minicom needs to be disabled

C-ax > lukke minicom
"det er en sånn crazy bug som gjør at du må ta ut nettverkskabelen når du skal gjøre det her"

root/perper


How to start minicom:
	minicom -o -D /dev/ttyS0
	restart the stk1000 (or hit the reset button)
	log in with root/perper
how to get IP from STK1000:
	ifconfig
	note: the ethernet cable has to be plugged into the slot closest to the power outlet.

129.241.103.186


Enabling the LED driver:
		insmod led_driver.ko
	mknod /dev/leds c $(grep leds /proc/devices | awk '{print $1}') 0
Removing a driver
	rmmod <drivername>
		# without the .ko
	rm /dev/leds
		# do we have to do this one?
	The LED drivers work!
	Whooo.

scoring should be exclusively based on judgments and we could use the LEDs to indicate either life or which player is winning (has more points)

Note to self: check if jumpers are set correctly.

I think we're supposed to read ch 1-3 and 9 of Linux Device Drivers.

SOUNDS! I think I am hearing them.
#alsamixer
	the card was muted. unmuted it in alsamixer and now cat /dev/random > /dev/dsp pumps out white noise.
oh wow all I need to do is write a short C program that forwards some .ogg file to /dev/dsp? I have no idea how to do that.

"suckvensielt arbeid"

We did some prototype testing and came to the conclusion that having two players control each trying to use four buttons on the board simultaneously did not result in an enjoyable experience.
Our testers preferred being the sole user of the STK1000's buttons.
A possible explanation for this is that all of our testers were above the age of 20 and did not posess the child-like hand size required to operate four neighbouring STK1000 buttons at the same time.


Q: Where on the screen is origo? Do we have to rotate our bitmaps?

Test: ghetto profiling > selected functions print how long they have been running to the console, allowing us to evaluate their efficiency. This technique is dubbed ``a sort of ghetto profiling''.

Q: Where could we put a glossary of StepMania-words?
Arrows: the arrows that scroll across the screen representing the rhythm of the song.
Stationary arrows: the stationary arrows (or targets) the arrows approach.
Dance platform/mat: a type of controller pressure sensitive areas that correspond to the arrows.
Song: a ``song'' in StepMania includes the actual song/sound track and its steps.
Dance pattern: the set of arrows for a given song at a given difficulty.
Steps: alternative name for ``dance pattern''.
Step: all the arrows at a given time value. All arrows in a step have to be pressed within the step's time window for it to register as a hit.
Note: alternate name for ``step''.
Double: a type of step containing two arrows.
Triples (trips): steps containing three arrows.
Quadruples (quads): steps containing four arrows.
Judgment: A ``score'' given for each step hit.

Note: SLDDD treats each individual arrow as a step.

the entire vidya is single threaded, meaning the playback of music runs in the same thread as the rest of the game. Because threading is for pussies.
