vi letet gjennom boksen med sd-kort og valgte et SanDisk Ultra II 2.0GB, med USB 2.0 kompabilitet. Dette var det kortet med mest lagringsplass.
Når bryteren på kortet er nede (nærmest usb-enden) er det i skrivebeskyttet modus ("lock")

Vi følger instruksjonene i oeving3_guidelines.txt

after exiting cfdisk there is a slight delay before it lets you open it again. In this window it just tells you "FATAL ERROR: Cannot open disk drive"

during stage 5/6 the sdcard is not automagically mounted in media/<name assigned in step 4>. Manually mounting it requires root. We attempted to drop down to graphical mode.

We decided to get a new sdcard because our initial pick was pre-broken.

wait why does it work to request the same range on both the led and button drivers? According to http://www.makelinux.net/ldd3/chp-9-sect-2 it seems like it shouldn't.

We are using Allegro 4.2

We are implementing stuff from stepmania

hardware flow control in minicom needs to be disabled

C-ax > lukke minicom
"det er en sånn crazy bug som gjør at du må ta ut nettverkskabelen når du skal gjøre det her"

root/perper


How to start minicom:
	minicom -o -D /dev/ttyS0
	restart the stk1000 (or hit the reset button)
	log in with root/perper
how to get IP from STK1000:
	ifconfig
	note: the ethernet cable has to be plugged into the slot closest to the power outlet.

Enabling the LED driver:
		insmod led_driver.ko
	mknod /dev/leds c $(grep leds /proc/devices | awk '{print $1}') 0
Removing a driver
	rmmod <drivername>
		# without the .ko
	rm /dev/leds
		# do we have to do this one?
	The LED drivers work!
	Whooo.

scoring should be exclusively based on judgments and we could use the LEDs to indicate either life or which player is winning (has more points)

Note to self: check if jumpers are set correctly.

I think we're supposed to read ch 1-3 and 9 of Linux Device Drivers.

SOUNDS! I think I am hearing them.
#alsamixer
	the card was muted. unmuted it in alsamixer and now cat /dev/random > /dev/dsp pumps out white noise.
oh wow all I need to do is write a short C program that forwards some .ogg file to /dev/dsp? I have no idea how to do that.
