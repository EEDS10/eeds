vi letet gjennom boksen med sd-kort og valgte et SanDisk Ultra II 2.0GB, med USB 2.0 kompabilitet. Dette var det kortet med mest lagringsplass.
Når bryteren på kortet er nede (nærmest usb-enden) er det i skrivebeskyttet modus ("lock")

Vi følger instruksjonene i oeving3_guidelines.txt

after exiting cfdisk there is a slight delay before it lets you open it again. In this window it just tells you "FATAL ERROR: Cannot open disk drive"

during stage 5/6 the sdcard is not automagically mounted in media/<name assigned in step 4>. Manually mounting it requires root. We attempted to drop down to graphical mode.

We decided to get a new sdcard because our initial pick was pre-broken.

wait why does it work to request the same range on both the led and button drivers? According to http://www.makelinux.net/ldd3/chp-9-sect-2 it seems like it shouldn't.

scoring should be exclusively based on judgments and we could use the LEDs to indicate either life or which player is winning (has more points)

Note to self: check if jumpers are set correctly.
