\part{Abstract}

This report is the solution to assignment 1 of TDT4258 at NTNU, spring 2013.
In the assigment, an Atmel STK1000 development board is programmed to display a moveable LED 'paddle' using AVR32 assembly and the GNU tool chain.

\part{Introduction}

\input{introduction.tex}

\part{Description and Methodology}

This is the description and methodology.

\subsection{Configuration of the STK1000}

\subsubsection{Jumpers}

The STK1000 has <number> jumpers that can be set to configure the board.
For this assignment, the following settings were set for the jumpers:

* SW1
Set to SPI0.
This is because <reason>.


* SW2
Set to PS2A/MMCI/USART1. 
This enables <something>.

* SW3
Set to SSC0/PWM[0,1]/GCLK to turn on <whatever>.

* SW5
Set to LCDC.
Doing this causes <stuff>.

* SW6
Set to GPIO.
This is because <reason>.

* JP4
Set to "INT. DAC".
Sets the right audio channel to use the internal digital-to-analog converter (DAC).
This is has no effect on this assignment, but is included here for completeness.

* JP5
Set to "INT. DAC".
Sets the left audio channel to use the internal digital-to-analog converter (DAC).
This is has no effect on this assignment, but is included here for completeness.

\subsubsection{GPIO connections}

<General info about GPIO on STK1000>.
The connectors were connected to some pins using a flat cable, as shown in diagram.
<diagram>.


\subsection{Programming environment}

\subsubsection{JTAGICE}

<General info about JTAGICE>. The JTAGICE was connected to the STK1000 (taking care not to connect the connector upside-down) and the PC using <cables>.

\subsubsection{GNU Debugger}

\subsubsection{Make, other tools etc}

\subsection{Development of the program}

\subsubsection{Setting up the LED diodes}

\subsubsection{Setting up the buttons}

\subsubsection{Interrupt Routine}

\subsubsection{Refactoring and Modularization}

\subsubsection{Register Overview}
