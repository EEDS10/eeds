It is likely that our measuring equipment as well as methods could be improved if he had more knowledge about such things or more time with which we could attempt to figure it out.

The power consumption could probably be reduced further by reducing the CPU's clock speed (\cite{AT32AP7000-prelim}, pg 933).

The program's code could be further optimized by rewriting it so that it employs less branches. Branching is expensive in terms of clock cycles, and fewer clock cycles equals lower power consumption.
