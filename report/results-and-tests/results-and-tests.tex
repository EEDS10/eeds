\subsection{Energy Efficiency}

The STK1000 offers 5 power pin pairs that may be used to measure current flow, and therefore also energy efficiency.
These 5 pins are situated on the daughterboard, see figure \ref{power-pins-location}.
Current flow through the pins was measured by connecting an ampere meter in series.
Current flow was measured on all five pin pairs on two different versions of the program: the final optimized interrupt-based program, and an earlier busy-wait based program without debouncing.
For both programs current flow was measured twice: once with the program in an idle state, and once where the paddle was moved about by a user frantically pressing \texttt{SW0} and \texttt{SW2} as fast as possible.
The ampere meter used was a BST BS1901W, with a reported accuracy of +-(1.2\% +3d) CITE http://www.docstoc.com/docs/67828383/BS1901W .

The measurements can be found in table \ref{energy-measurements-table}

\subsection{Discussion}

maybe we could turn down the clock speeds, see pagenumer 933 of http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc32003.pdf
