\subsection{Energy Efficiency}

The STK1000 offers 5 power pin pairs that may be used to measure current flow, and therefore also energy efficiency.
These 5 pins are situated on the daughterboard, see figure \ref{power-pins-location}.
Current flow was measured over the pins by connecting an amperemeter in series.

\subsection{Discussion}

maybe we could turn down the clock speeds, see pagenumer 933 of http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc32003.pdf
