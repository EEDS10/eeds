This report presents a solution to assignment \#1 of TDT4258 at NTNU, spring 2013.
In the assigment, an Atmel STK1000 development board was programmed to display a moveable LED ''paddle'' using AVR32 assembly and the GNU tool chain.
Interrupts were used rather than busy-waiting to achieve better energy efficiency.
The goal of this assignment was to introduce students to programming microcontrollers, as well as introducing students to the GNU toolchain, and specifically GNU Makefiles and using GDB as a debugging tool.

The board was successfully programmed in an energy-efficient manner so that a single LED is lit at a time, representing a paddle, which responds to the appropriate buttons being pushed.
