The objective of this lab assignment was to make a program for the STK1000 which allowed the user to control which of the LED diodes on a row of diodes should light up.
This was to be accomplished by changing the selected diode to an adjacent diode, either to the right by pressing button 0 or to the left by pressing button 2.
