The objective of this lab assignment is to make a program for the STK1000 which allows the user to control which of the LED diodes on a row of diodes should light up.
This should be accomplished by changing the selected diode to an adjacent diode, either to the right by pressing button 0 or to the left by pressing button 2, effectively letting the user move a ''paddle'' along the row of LEDs.

In order to solve this task, it is essential to obtain a basic understanding of the STK1000 and microcontrollers in order to correctly set up the hardware for input/output.
It is also important to acquire basic knowledge of assembly for the AVR32 in order to be able to program, and more specifically how to handle interrupts in assembly in order to achieve high energy efficiency.
