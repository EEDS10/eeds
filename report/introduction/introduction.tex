The objective of this lab assignment was to make a program for the STK1000 which allowed the user to control which of the LED diodes on a row of diodes should light up.
This was to be accomplished by changing the selected diode to an adjacent diode, either to the right by pressing button 0 or to the left by pressing button 2.

In order to solve this task, it is essential with a basic understanding of the STK1000 in order to correctly set up the hardware for input/outut.
It is also important with basic knowledge of assembly for the AVR32 in order to be able to program, and more specifically how to handle interrupts in assembly in order to achieve high energy efficiency.
