The instructions presented in the compendium were followed in an attempt to employ the GNU debugger, but the proxy connection could not be established.
Because of this, the GNU debugger did not play a important role in the development of the solution.
After the main development of the program was complete, the proper setup procedure for the debugger was discovered by another group and subsequently shared.
For completeness, the already developed program was debugged using the GNU debugger, to confirm that debugging did indeed work.
As the setup procedure differs somewhat from that of the compendium, it is reproduced in its entirety here.
TODO: reproduce setup procedure here.
TODO: run up to the lab and use gdb a bit, so we can write about it here afterwards.
