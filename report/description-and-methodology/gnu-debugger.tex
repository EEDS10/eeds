We followed the instructions presented in the compendium in an attempt to employ the GNU debugger, but were confused by the interface as we had not read the recommended further reading material supplied in the compendium.
So we chose to not employ the GNU debugger in the development of our solution.
TODO: run up to the lab and use gdb a bit, so we can write about it here afterwards.
