\section{Development of the program}

This section details the steps taken during the development of the program.
Initially, a bare-bones program was developed with minimal functionality, to get familiar with the environment.
Features were added iteratively, starting with simple LED and button integration, and moving on to more sophisticated interrupt-oriented logic/program flow.
