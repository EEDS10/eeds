The STK1000 provides a general purpose input/output (GPIO) interface with 32 signal lines.
16 of the 32 available lines are in this assigment connected to on-board I/O devices on the STK1000.
These devices are 8 on-board LEDs, which will be used as a rudimentary paddle display, and 8 on-board switches, which will be used as player controls.

The buttons are connected to GPIO0-GPIO7 (J1 on the STK1000) using a flat cable as in (diagram X). This maps the buttons to ports 0-7 of PIOB.
The choice of low port numbers 0-7 is convenient for coding, and the choice of PIOB as opposed to PIOC is purely mnemonic ('B' for buttons).

The LEDs are connected to GPIO16-GPIO23 (J3 on the STK1000) using a flat cable as in (diagram X). This maps the LEDs to ports 0-7 of PIOC.
Having the same port numbers for the buttons and the LEDs is a nice convenience for cleaner code and more efficient code, as translation from button ports to LED ports is not necessary.
