The AP7000 sisterboard on the STK1000 provides a JTAG interface which is used for programming and debugging of the board.
The development PC was connected to the JTAG interface of the STK1000 using an Atmel JTAGICE mk II (firmware 7.29).
The JTAGICE does not require external power as long as it is connected to the PC over USB.
