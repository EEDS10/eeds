Before interrupts can be utilized we have to configure the board in an appropriate manner.
This process is outlined on page 24 of the compendium \cite{lab-compendium}.


Buttons are connected to PIO B.
LEDs are connected to PIO C.


% subsubsubsection seems to not exist
%\subsubsubsection{Enabling interrupts}
% load PIO B base address into r2
lddpc r2, piob_offset
% load the specified bits we want to enable interrupts for into r5
mov r5, SW_0 | SW_2
% enables interrupts for SW_0 and SW_2 by setting the appropriate bits to 1 in the interrupt enable register
st.w r2[AVR32_PIO_IER], r5
% loads the address of our button_interrupt_routine into r8
mov r8, button_interrupt_routine
% tells the interrupt controller where the interrupt routine is
st.w r7[AVR32_INTC_IPR14], r8
