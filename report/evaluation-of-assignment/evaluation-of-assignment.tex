The assignment itself was both challenging and interesting.
It provided an environment in which wits and the ability to tough it out come in handy.
However, information regarding certain aspects of the assignment could have been stressed more.
For example, during the intro lecture to the assignment\cite{lab-intro-lecture} it was mentioned that we should be careful with the board's sleep modes.
Having no prior experience with the STK1000, the first sleep mode we tested was sleep 5.
Of course, this rendered the card unusable.
Explicitly stating somewhere (i.e. in the compendium) that sleep 5 should never be used will probably reduce the amount of soft-bricked boards by quite a bit.

Getting a chance to ''play around'' with the lab equipment was very enjoyable, however it wouldn't hurt if the lab computers were a bit more robust (i.e. they should probably survive a reboot).
Also the lab could have better air conditioning, but the authors realize that fixing this probably requires significant resources.

In summary: 9/10, would recommend to other students.
