The assignment itself was both challenging and interesting.
It provides an environment in which wits and being able to tough it out come in handy.
However, information regarding certain aspects of the assignment could have been stressed more.
For example, during the intro lecture to the assignment\cite{lab-intro-lecture} it was mentioned that we should be careful with the board's sleep modes.
Having no prior experience with the STK1000, the first sleep mode we tested was sleep 5.

Getting a chance to ''play around'' with the lab equipment was very enjoyable, however it wouldn't hurt if the lab computers were a bit more robust (i.e. they should probably survive a reboot).
Also the lab could have better air conditioning.

9/10 would recommend to younger students.
